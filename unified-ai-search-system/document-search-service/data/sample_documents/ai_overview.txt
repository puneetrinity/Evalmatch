            Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.
            Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.
            
            Natural Language Processing (NLP) helps computers understand human language.
            Computer Vision enables machines to interpret visual information.
