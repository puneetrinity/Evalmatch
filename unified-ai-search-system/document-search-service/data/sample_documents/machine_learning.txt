            Machine Learning algorithms build models based on training data to make predictions or decisions.
            
            Supervised Learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.
            Unsupervised Learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples.
            Reinforcement Learning learns through interaction with an environment.
            
            Popular algorithms include Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.
