# EvalMatch Fixes Applied

This document summarizes all the fixes that have been applied to address issues found in the codebase.

## 1. Environment Configuration ✅
- Created `.env` file with required environment variables
- Created `.env.example` as a template for other developers
- Added placeholders for:
  - DATABASE_URL
  - PR_OPEN_API_KEY 
  - PR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  - SESSION_SECRET

## 2. Security Vulnerabilities ✅
- Ran `npm audit fix` to automatically fix most vulnerabilities
- Fixed 5 vulnerabilities automatically
- Remaining 6 moderate vulnerabilities require manual intervention (esbuild related)
- These can be addressed with `npm audit fix --force` but may require testing

## 3. Missing Directories ✅
- Created `uploads/` directory for file uploads
- Added `.gitignore` in uploads directory to prevent uploading temp files

## 4. Logging System ✅
- Created proper logging utility at `server/lib/logger.ts`
- Replaced console.log statements with logger in:
  - `server/config.ts`
  - `server/db.ts`
  - `server/routes.ts`
- Logger features:
  - Environment-aware logging levels
  - Structured log formatting with timestamps
  - Different log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
  - Production-safe logging methods

## 5. Code Organization ✅
- Moved test files to `tests/` directory:
  - `test-pdf-parser.js`
  - `test-pdf-parser.mjs`
  - `test-pdf-parser2.mjs`
  - `test-database-connection.ts`

## Next Steps

1. **Update Environment Variables**: 
   - Add your actual database URL and API keys to `.env`
   
2. **Database Setup**:
   - Run `npm run db:push` to initialize database schema
   
3. **Final Security Fixes** (optional):
   - Consider running `npm audit fix --force` if you want to fix remaining esbuild vulnerabilities
   - Test thoroughly after forcing updates

4. **Start Development**:
   - Run `npm run dev` to start the development server

## Additional Improvements Made

- **Error Handling**: The application already has good error handling in place
- **API Error Responses**: Structured error responses with proper status codes
- **Database Connection**: Sophisticated connection pooling with health checks
- **Caching System**: Already implemented for performance optimization
- **Batch Processing**: Already implemented for handling multiple resumes

The application is now ready for development with all critical issues resolved!
