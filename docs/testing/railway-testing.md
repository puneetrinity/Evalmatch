### Test Performance Expectations
- Health check response: < 5 seconds
- API endpoint response: < 10 seconds
- Concurrent requests: 5+ simultaneous
- Memory usage: Stable under load
- Application startup: < 2 minutes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Failures**
   ```bash
   # Check Railway PostgreSQL service
   railway logs
   railway variables
   ```

2. **AI Provider Connection Issues**
   ```bash
   # Verify API keys in Railway dashboard
   # Check environment variable format
   ```

3. **Memory Issues**
   ```bash
   # Increase Railway service memory
   # Check NODE_OPTIONS configuration
   ```

4. **Timeout Issues**
   ```bash
   # Increase TEST_TIMEOUT in environment
   # Check Railway service startup time
   ```

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check Railway service status
railway status

# View application logs
railway logs --tail

# Check environment variables
railway variables

# Connect to Railway shell
railway shell
```

## Integration with CI/CD

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically:
1. Runs local tests before deployment
2. Deploys to Railway on main branch
3. Validates deployment with comprehensive tests
4. Reports status and uploads artifacts

### Required GitHub Secrets
- `RAILWAY_TOKEN`: Railway API token
- `RAILWAY_TEST_URL`: Deployed application URL

## Best Practices

1. **Environment Management**
   - Use Railway environment groups
   - Separate staging and production
   - Validate all required variables

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Run setup validation before tests
   - Test both success and failure scenarios
   - Monitor memory usage during tests

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Set reasonable timeout values
   - Monitor response times
   - Track memory usage trends

4. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful test failures
   - Comprehensive error logging
   - Automated cleanup procedures

## Support and Debugging

For issues with Railway testing:
1. Check the test report: `railway-test-report.json`
2. Review Railway logs: `railway logs`
3. Validate environment variables
4. Ensure all services are running

The testing setup is designed to be robust and provide clear feedback on any deployment issues.
