# Hybrid Analyzer Enhanced Features - Gradual Rollout Strategy

## 🎯 Rollout Philosophy

**Telemetry First, Features Second**: Enable monitoring before activating new features to ensure we can observe behavior and catch issues early.

## 📊 Phase 1: Telemetry & Monitoring (Week 1)

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Enable telemetry for monitoring (safe to enable immediately)
HYBRID_TELEMETRY=true

# Keep existing behavior (all other features default to safe values)
HYBRID_BIAS_ADJUSTMENT=false
HYBRID_CONTAMINATION_FILTERING=true  # Existing behavior
HYBRID_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=50          # Existing behavior
HYBRID_ML_WEIGHT_CAP=0.4            # Existing behavior  
HYBRID_LLM_WEIGHT_CAP=0.8           # Existing behavior
HYBRID_CONFIDENCE_FLOOR=0.75        # Aligned with CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLDS

# A/B Testing disabled initially
EXPERIMENT_HYBRID_ANALYZER_THRESHOLDS=false
EXPERIMENT_ESCO_CONTAMINATION_V2=false
```

### Monitoring Setup
- Enable telemetry logging to capture baseline metrics
- Monitor performance impact of enhanced logging
- Establish baseline for key metrics:
  - Abstain detection rates
  - Confidence score distributions  
  - Processing times
  - ML vs LLM weight distributions

### Success Criteria
- ✅ No performance degradation (< 5% increase in processing time)
- ✅ Clean telemetry data flowing to logs
- ✅ No errors in enhanced logging

## 🧪 Phase 2: A/B Testing Framework (Week 2)

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Continue telemetry
HYBRID_TELEMETRY=true

# Enable A/B testing at 10% participation
EXPERIMENT_HYBRID_ANALYZER_THRESHOLDS=true
EXPERIMENT_HYBRID_ANALYZER_RATE=0.10      # Start with 10% of users
EXPERIMENT_HYBRID_ANALYZER_VARIANT=experimental

# Monitor ESCO contamination improvements 
EXPERIMENT_ESCO_CONTAMINATION_V2=true
EXPERIMENT_ESCO_CONTAMINATION_RATE=0.10   # Start with 10% of users
EXPERIMENT_ESCO_CONTAMINATION_VARIANT=wordBoundary
```

### Monitoring & Analysis
- Compare control vs experimental group metrics
- Monitor abstain flow preservation
- Track contamination filtering effectiveness
- Measure user experience impact

### Success Criteria
- ✅ A/B test framework working correctly (consistent user assignment)
- ✅ Experimental group shows improved accuracy (>5% improvement)
- ✅ No increase in false positives/negatives
- ✅ Contamination filtering more precise (fewer false blocks)

## 🚀 Phase 3: Bias Adjustment Feature (Week 3)

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Continue all previous settings
HYBRID_TELEMETRY=true
EXPERIMENT_HYBRID_ANALYZER_THRESHOLDS=true
EXPERIMENT_HYBRID_ANALYZER_RATE=0.25      # Increase to 25%

# Enable bias adjustment for experimental group only
HYBRID_BIAS_ADJUSTMENT=true
```

### Monitoring Focus
- Track bias detection and adjustment rates
- Monitor fairness metrics improvements
- Ensure no degradation in overall match quality
- Watch for any bias overcorrection issues

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Bias detection working accurately (>70% precision on known biased samples)
- ✅ Fairness metrics improved (bias scores reduced by >20%)
- ✅ Overall match quality maintained or improved
- ✅ No significant performance impact

## 📈 Phase 4: Full Feature Rollout (Week 4)

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Full feature activation for production
HYBRID_TELEMETRY=true
HYBRID_BIAS_ADJUSTMENT=true
HYBRID_CONTAMINATION_FILTERING=true

# Expanded A/B testing
EXPERIMENT_HYBRID_ANALYZER_THRESHOLDS=true
EXPERIMENT_HYBRID_ANALYZER_RATE=0.50      # 50% participation
EXPERIMENT_ESCO_CONTAMINATION_RATE=0.50   # 50% participation

# Production-optimized thresholds (if needed)
HYBRID_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=45               # Slight optimization from A/B results
```

### Production Monitoring
- Full feature telemetry analysis
- User satisfaction metrics
- System performance under full load
- Long-term stability assessment

### Success Criteria  
- ✅ All features stable at 50% traffic
- ✅ User satisfaction metrics improved or maintained
- ✅ System performance within acceptable bounds
- ✅ Ready for 100% rollout

## 🎉 Phase 5: Complete Rollout (Week 5+)

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Full production deployment
HYBRID_TELEMETRY=true
HYBRID_BIAS_ADJUSTMENT=true  
HYBRID_CONTAMINATION_FILTERING=true

# Disable A/B testing (feature fully rolled out)
EXPERIMENT_HYBRID_ANALYZER_THRESHOLDS=false
EXPERIMENT_ESCO_CONTAMINATION_V2=false

# Optimized production settings
HYBRID_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=45
HYBRID_ML_WEIGHT_CAP=0.4
HYBRID_LLM_WEIGHT_CAP=0.8
HYBRID_CONFIDENCE_FLOOR=0.75
```

## 🛡️ Rollback Strategy

### Immediate Rollback (If Critical Issues)
```bash
# Revert to minimal safe configuration
HYBRID_TELEMETRY=false
HYBRID_BIAS_ADJUSTMENT=false
HYBRID_CONTAMINATION_FILTERING=true  # Keep existing behavior
EXPERIMENT_HYBRID_ANALYZER_THRESHOLDS=false
EXPERIMENT_ESCO_CONTAMINATION_V2=false
```

### Partial Rollback (If Specific Feature Issues)
```bash
# Keep telemetry, disable problematic feature only
HYBRID_TELEMETRY=true
HYBRID_BIAS_ADJUSTMENT=false  # Disable if bias adjustment causes issues
# Keep other working features enabled
```

## 📊 Key Metrics to Monitor

### Performance Metrics
- Average processing time per analysis
- Memory usage patterns
- Error rates and types
- Database query performance

### Quality Metrics  
- Match accuracy (precision/recall)
