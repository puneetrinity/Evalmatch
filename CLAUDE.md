# EvalMatch Project Documentation & Development Guide

> **Comprehensive guide for AI-powered recruitment platform development**

## Git Remotes
This repository has multiple remotes configured:

- **origin**: `https://github.com/puneetrinity/Evalmatch.git`
  - Main Evalmatch repository
  - Deployed to: `evalmatch.app` on Railway

- **improved**: `https://github.com/puneetrinity/improve-Evalmatch.git`
  - Improved Evalmatch repository (older remote name)
  
- **new-origin**: `https://github.com/puneetrinity/improved-EvalMatch.git`
  - Current improved Evalmatch repository
  - Deployed to: `recruitment-corner.scholavar.com` on Railway

## Deployment Instructions

### For Scholavar Recruitment Corner
When pushing changes for Scholavar recruitment corner:
```bash
git push new-origin main
```
This pushes to the `improved-EvalMatch` repository which is deployed to `recruitment-corner.scholavar.com`

### For Main Evalmatch App
When pushing changes for the main Evalmatch app:
```bash
git push origin main
```
This pushes to the main `Evalmatch` repository which is deployed to `evalmatch.app`

## Important Notes
- Both applications are deployed on Railway
- The same local codebase is used for both deployments
- Use the appropriate remote when pushing changes based on which app you want to update

## üèóÔ∏è **Key Architectural Patterns**

### **Core System Patterns**
- **Result Pattern**: Sophisticated `Result<T, E>` pattern instead of try/catch for predictable error handling
- **Type Safety**: Extensive TypeScript with custom error classes and Zod validation
- **AI Abstraction**: Multi-provider AI setup (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq) with intelligent fallback strategies
- **Performance Focus**: Redis caching and parallel processing implementations

### **SDK Architecture Patterns**
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Resilient service calls with failure thresholds (5 failures) and 60s recovery timeout
- **Interceptor Chain**: Middleware pattern for request/response processing with authentication, timing, and debug logging
- **Request Deduplication**: Promise coalescence to prevent duplicate API calls (prevents 90%+ of duplicates)
- **Multi-layer Caching**: Memory + IndexedDB with TTL-based expiration and LRU eviction

### **Error Handling Philosophy**
- **Context-Rich Errors**: Every error includes request ID, timing, circuit breaker state, and recovery actions
- **Graceful Degradation**: Systems continue operating with reduced functionality when services fail
- **Proactive Error Prevention**: Circuit breakers and retry logic with exponential backoff [100ms, 500ms, 1s, 2s, 5s]
- **Developer-Friendly Messages**: Errors include actionable guidance ("Check your plan limits at dashboard.evalmatch.com/billing")

## üéØ **Specific Project Context**

### **Document Processing Architecture**
- **Resume/Job Description Parsing**: Secure PDF/DOCX processing with validation
- **Security Validation**: Input sanitization, file type verification, content scanning
- **Multi-format Support**: PDF, DOCX, TXT with consistent extraction patterns
- **Performance Optimization**: Parallel processing for batch operations

### **Database Architecture**
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database operations with PostgreSQL
- **Schema Structure**: Users, resumes, job_descriptions, analyses, batches with proper foreign keys
- **Migration Strategy**: Versioned migrations with rollback support
- **Connection Management**: Pooling and retry logic for Railway PostgreSQL

### **Testing Infrastructure**
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 74+ unit tests with 83%+ coverage (Target: 85%+)
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit (Vitest), Integration (Real DB), MSW for API mocking
- **Mock Service Worker**: Realistic API testing without actual network calls
- **Performance Testing**: Bundle size monitoring, request timing benchmarks

### **Deployment Patterns**
- **Railway-Specific**: Multiple remotes for different environments
- **Environment Management**: Separate configs for production vs staging
- **Health Monitoring**: Custom health checks for Railway infrastructure
- **Database Migration**: Safe schema changes in production Railway environment

## üîß **Code Standards & Patterns**

### **Result Type System**
```typescript
// Preferred pattern throughout codebase
export type Result<T, E = Error> = {
  success: true;
  data: T;
} | {
  success: false;
  error: E;
};

// Usage example
async function processResume(file: File): Promise<Result<ResumeData, ProcessingError>> {
  // Implementation returns Result instead of throwing
}
```

### **AI Integration Patterns**
- **Provider Fallback Chain**: Primary ‚Üí Secondary ‚Üí Tertiary provider switching
- **Cost Optimization**: Intelligent routing based on request complexity and user tier
- **Response Caching**: AI response caching to reduce API costs (80%+ cache hit rate)
- **Performance Tiering**: Different AI providers for different user subscription levels

### **File Organization Standards**
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/                 # Backend API and services
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/               # Core business logic
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/            # API endpoints

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sdks/typescript/       # SDK development
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                 # Comprehensive test suite
```

### **Testing Requirements**
- **Unit Tests**: All core business logic must have unit tests (85%+ coverage)
- **Integration Tests**: Database operations and API endpoints
- **MSW Integration**: All external API calls mocked with realistic responses
- **Performance Tests**: Bundle size limits (<50KB for SDK), request timing benchmarks

## ‚ö° **Performance & Optimization Standards**

### **Bundle Optimization**
- **Tree-shaking**: Enabled with `sideEffects: false` for optimal bundle sizes
- **Multi-format Builds**: ESM, CJS, UMD with proper type definitions
- **Size Monitoring**: Automated alerts when bundles exceed 50KB threshold
- **Source Maps**: Generated for debugging in development

### **Caching Strategies**
- **API Response Caching**: Redis for server-side, Memory + IndexedDB for client-side
- **Cache Invalidation**: TTL-based with smart invalidation on data changes
- **Cache Performance**: Monitor hit rates (target: 80%+ for repeated requests)
- **Offline Support**: Progressive Web App capabilities with cache fallbacks

### **Request Optimization**
- **Deduplication**: Prevent duplicate API calls within same request cycle
- **Batch Processing**: Group multiple operations for efficiency
- **Compression**: Response compression and optimal payload sizes
- **Connection Pooling**: Database and external API connection management
